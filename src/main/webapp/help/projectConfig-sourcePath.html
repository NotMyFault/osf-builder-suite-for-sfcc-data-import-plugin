    For example: &quot;<tt>scm/my-git-repo/metadata</tt>&quot;

    <ul>
        <li>
            If no include and no exclude patterns are setup then all files in the source path defined here
            will be included
        </li>
        <li>
            If include patterns are defined while no exclude patterns are defined then only the files matching the
            include patterns will be included
        </li>
        <li>
            If include patterns are not defined while exclude patterns are defined then all files in the source
            path defined here will be included with the exception of those matching the exclude patterns
        </li>
        <li>
            If both include patterns and exclude patterns are defined then only the files matching the
            include patterns and not matching the exclude patterns will be included
        </li>

    </ul>
